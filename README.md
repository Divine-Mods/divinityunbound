# Divinity Unbound

---

## Mod Description

Divinity Unbound is a magic mod that adds new armor, weapons, and tools forged from magical materials. 
Utility blocks and items are also crafted from magical materials; some of these utility blocks include ways to summon 
particular types of mobs or magically grab all the items floating in an area and automatically deposit in a below inventory. 
If magical utility items are your preference, maybe you want to get back to your base quicker with the Wand of Teleportation 
or maybe you want to shoot magical arrows with the Wand of The Archer.

## Getting Started

Venture into the world of minecraft and search for the elusive magic ore Celestite to get started.

Once you've found some ore and smelted it into Celestite, 
you can put it towards some tools, armor, 
or even a Chronos Time Accumulator.

A Chronos Time Accumulator will magically accumulate and distill grains of time 
as real time passes. You'll have to make some celestite infused stone and some 
golden celestite infused stone to make one but it'll be worth it.

---

## Next Steps

Now that you're magically distilling grains of time, you should be able to transmute 
it into other usable materials.

Some Celestium Dust and some Unholy Dust would be the next step towards 
controlling the divine, the unholy, space, and time.

Rumor is that Celestium Dust can only be obtained if a Grain of Time is used
on a magical golden block *very close to the gods on high*.

Unholy Dust however can only be obtained if a Grain of Time is 
used on an indestructible block in the underworld.

From here, you should be able to start dabbling into the more powerful 
magical items if you can obtain some Time Forged Ingots.

## "The End" Game

At this point you have some experience with magic and time but 
now I think it is time to master space as well.

If only I knew how to get to _the end_ of the road, I could try to 
use my Grains of Time on some Obsidian. I've heard that 
Obsidian has magical properties. The way it forms with lava and water 
is akin to the relationship of space and time.

If I could only figure out how to make this Space Dust I've read about 
then I would be able to make some Space Forged Ingots too.

## Blocks

Chronos Time Accumulator magically distills Grains of Time.

Divine Replicator summons copies of a mob that has been captured 
by a Wand of Capturing.

Generation Station generates resources depending on the foci placed within.

Mystic Chronograph creates a localized time space bubble and can 
drastically speeds up the block below it.

Space Siphon pulls in items within a radius around it and 
pushes them to the inventory below. 

Unholy Silencer - Attacks mobs within a radius around it. Utilizes sword in inventory to calculate damage. 
(Does take into account sword enchantments, e.g. Looting, Sharpness, etc)

Space Time Evaporator - Evaporates space time on to coal, causing it to recrystalize and form space fuel. Produces energy.

Space Time Amalgamator - Combines Celestium Dust, Unholy Dust, and Space Dust to create 
Liquid Space Time. Needs power.

Wormhole Transporter - Creates a localized wormhole that is linked to another transporter. Can move Items, Liquids, and Energy.
Use an Import or Export card to link to another wormhole.

Item Trashcan - Voids any item inserted into it

Fluid Trashcan - Voids any fluid inserted into it

Energy Trashcan - Voids any energy inserted into it

### Wormhole Transporter

Simple example using the Wormhole Transporter:
You have 2 chests that you want to move items between across some distance.

- Place a Wormhole Transporter on each chest.
- Take an Import Card and Shift+Right Click **on the Wormhole Transporter you want to take from** to save the coordinates to the card.
- Place the Import Card with the saved coords **into the Wormhole Transporter you want to move items to.**
- Place a **blank Export Card into the Wormhole Transporter you want to take from** to start extracting items.

Items are now being extracted into the first Wormhole Transporter with the blank Export Card, then they are automatically pulled into the
Wormhole Transporter with the linked Import Card, and finally the Transporter with the linked Import Card is pushing into the chest it is placed on.

You can achieve the same goal by using a linked Export Card and a blank Import Card instead. 

**You only need 1 linked card within the system**

A linked Export Card will _pull_ from the neighboring block and _push_ to the linked Wormhole Transporter.

A linked Import Card will _push_ from the neighboring block and _pull_ from the linked Wormhole Transporter.

### Block Upgrades

There are currently speed and quantity upgrades available 
to enhance the block they are placed around.

You are able to place upgrades in the 8 blocks (on the same Y level) 
surrounding the block you are upgrading.

| Space Time Amalgamator   | N             | N                |
| Wormhole Transporter     | N             | N                |

### Wands

Unholy Wand pulls ores from underground to the surface.

Wand of Capturing captures a mob it is used on, 
can use the wand on a block to release the mob. If 
you have a captured mob in the wand, place in the 
Divine Replicator to summon more of them!

Wand of Respiration provides water breathing and dolphin's 
grace on use.

Wand of Teleportation can be shift right clicked on a block 
to save a location (check the item's tooltip to see the 
saved coordinates). Once a position has been saved, you can 
use the wand to teleport to the saved position. Shift right 
click in the air to clear the saved block position or shift 
right click on a different block to change the saved position.

Divine Wand of Flight provides 1 minute of creative flight on 
use.

Wand of The Archer shoots spectral arrows and can be enchanted with bow enchantments.

Wand of the Celebration shoots firework rockets (duration 3).

Wand of Fire Bending summons temporary lava in a plus pattern and provides Fire Resistance. Can be used on mobs and blocks.
