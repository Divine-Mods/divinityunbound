# Divinity Unbound

---

## Getting Started

Venture into the world of minecraft and search for the elusive magic ore Celestite to get started.

Once you've found some ore and smelted it into Celestite, 
you can put it towards some tools, armor, 
or even a Chronos Time Accumulator.

A Chronos Time Accumulator will magically accumulate and distill grains of time 
as real time passes. You'll have to make some celestite infused stone and some 
golden celestite infused stone to make one but it'll be worth it.

---

## Next Steps

Now that you're magically distilling grains of time, you should be able to transmute 
it into other usable materials.

Some Celestium Dust and some Unholy Dust would be the next step towards 
controlling the divine, the unholy, space, and time.

Rumor is that Celestium Dust can only be obtained if a Grain of Time is used
on a magical golden block *very close to the gods on high*.

Unholy Dust however can only be obtained if a Grain of Time is 
used on an indestructible block in the underworld.

From here, you should be able to start dabbling into the more powerful 
magical items if you can obtain some Time Forged Ingots.

## "The End" Game

At this point you have some experience with magic and time but 
now I think it is time to master space as well.

If only I knew how to get to _the end_ of the road, I could try to 
use my Grains of Time on some Obsidian. I've heard that 
Obsidian has magical properties. The way it forms with lava and water 
is akin to the relationship of space and time.

If I could only figure out how to make this Space Dust I've read about 
then I would be able to make some Space Forged Ingots too.

## Blocks

Chronos Time Accumulator magically distills Grains of Time.

Divine Replicator summons copies of a mob that has been captured 
by a Wand of Capturing.

Generation Station generates resources depending on the foci placed within.

Mystic Chronograph creates a localized time space bubble and can 
drastically speeds up the block below it.

Space Siphon pulls in items within a radius around it and 
pushes them to the inventory below. 

### Block Upgrades

There are currently speed and quantity upgrades available 
to enhance the block they are placed around.

You are able to place upgrades in the 8 blocks (on the same Y level) 
surrounding the block you are upgrading.

| x                        | Speed Upgrade | Quantity Upgrade |
|--------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Chronos Time Accumulator | Y             | Y                |
| Divine Replicator        | Y             | Y                |
| Generation Station       | Y             | Y                |
| Mystic Chronograph       | N             | N                |
| Space Siphon             | Y             | N                |

### Wands

Unholy Wand pulls ores from underground to the surface.

Wand of Capturing captures a mob it is used on, 
can use the wand on a block to release the mob. If 
you have a captured mob in the wand, place in the 
Divine Replicator to summon more of them!

Wand of Respiration provides water breathing and dolphin's 
grace on use.

Wand of Teleportation can be shift right clicked on a block 
to save a location (check the item's tooltip to see the 
saved coordinates). Once a position has been saved, you can 
use the wand to teleport to the saved position. Shift right 
click in the air to clear the saved block position or shift 
right click on a different block to change the saved position.

Divine Wand of Flight provides 1 minute of creative flight on 
use.
